<p>This was a project for Computer Systems I at Appalachian State. 
This project was a really valuable learning experience for me and is something that I am very proud to have completed. The idea was to simulate a CPU behavior of executing Y86 machine code in a pipelined manner, rather than sequentially. Requiring knowledge in CPU architecture, machine level code, C++, debugging, and memory. We worked in pairs to implement this project over the course of a semester and was also a valuable teamwork experience. The code can be found on my GitHub.</p>
