<p>This project started as a documentation writing excersise for Technical Writing. I decided to pick one of my favorite video games, Stardew Valley, and create a static wiki site that goes over some of the basics of the game. It is currently a static site but I would like to keep working on it by adding more content, and possibly swtiching to Javascript, HTML, and CSS. <a href="https://teaguejk.github.io/stardew_valley/">Here is the link to the site.</a></p>
