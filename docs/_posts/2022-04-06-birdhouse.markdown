This was my Capstone project for my senior year at Appalachian State. The goal is to create a birdhouse that detects motion and captures images/videos and create a website to display and collect information. With python, I have setup functionality to send emails and will be updating a mailing list each time a bird has been detected in the house, with an image attached.
